{abstract,"This is a stub generator for the ONC/RPC protocol.  Given a
protocol specification in the RPC syntax (RFC1831), the stub generator
will create client-side and server-side code for encoding and decoding
procedure calls into XDR-encoded network messages. Version 1.1 is rewritten
for R7 - faster XDR routines which generates less garbage."}.
