1.1 - 120730 - beta1 - Rui Xie, Alcatel-Lucent, Inc:
	- fix xdr parsing of enum, union
	- add feature random encoding for XDR encoding/decoding.

1.1 - 010903 - release - Martin Björklund, Alteon WebSystems:

- timeout fix.  the timeout specified is now RPC timeout, as it's
  supposed to be.

- pendinglen in rpc_client was not correctly calculated.

- fixed xdr decoding of union of bool.

- using catch ingenerated code to handle rpc errors.


1.1 - 010830 - beta5 - Jim Larson, Sendmail, Inc.:

- touchups for release


1.1 - 010302 - beta4 - Martin Björklund, Alteon WebSystems:

- fixed bug: xdr generation for unions of enum failed

- added support for starting rpc_server with port 0, i.e.
  it starts on a dynamic port, and uses pmap to register the port.

- fixed bug from beta3: when decoding unions, {default, Val} was
  returned, instead of real tag (e.g. {'REG_ERR', Val}

- fixed bug from beta3: generated xx_svc w/ procs with more than one
  argument didn't compile


1.1 - 001123 - beta3 - Martin Björklund, Alteon WebSystems:

- added doc/API.txt

- added rpc_server behaviour; erpcgen can generate code in the old
  gen_server style, or in a plain callback style

- rpc_server dispatch module API changed - handles stateful callback
  modules

- added new option 'svc_callback' to erpcgen, to generate code in the
  new style.

- rpc_client uses BIF timers, and cancels unused timers

- added explicit messages / callbacks to user's rpc_server
  implementation to keep track of tcp connections (i.e. msgs
  tcp_new and tcp_close).

- TODO
    o  examples not updated
    o  more doc in API.txt


1.1 - 001113 - beta2 - Martin Björklund, Alteon WebSystems:

- from beta1: fixed bug in generated svc code

- from beta1: udp didn't work at all in rpc_client

- generate rpc.app from Makefile

- NOTE: rpc_client:open returns a *linked* pid!

- removed some debug printouts from rpc_client

- using connected udp for rpc_client

- rewrote rpc_client to use explicit timers for each pending call
  instead of polling each second

- corrected deviation count in rpc_client

Q: rpc_client:controlling_process doesn't make any sense.  it's just a
   link.  the owner is not stored in the state - remove this function!
   


1.1 - 001110 - beta1

Martin Björklund, Alteon WebSystems:

- Generated code, rpc_server and rpc_client use the new bit
  syntax in R7.

- Generated XDR code speedup approx. a factor 3.

- reg_server handles UDP (as well as TCP).

- Handles more than one version of the rpc program at the
  time.

- Uses less processes (just two); can handle code changes
  better this way.

- Changed callback interface; added a client reference,
  so that the server can check client address with
  client_ip/1.  The generated x_svc code can be used
  directly as a dispatch module.

- Added rpc.x.  rpc_server and rpc_client uses the generated rpc_xdr
  module.

- rpc_server handles errors from callback functions correctly.

- API changed; start_link arguments changed.

- Removed dead code; rpc_reg and xdrlib.

- Needs R7 - if you don't like that; use rpc-1.0.


1.0

Scott Fritchie and Jim Larson of Sendmail, Inc. enhance Tony Rogvall's
original work with the following enhancements:

- Changed the XDR library to work with Binaries instead
  of lists of bytes.  For code that handles large opaque<>
  blocks, this improves the performance by an order of
  magnitude or more.

- Changed the RPC client-side server to work asynchronously
  and handle several outstanding requests at the same time.

- Made rpc_server: a stripped-down version of rpc_reg.

- Statistics-gathering, failure-detection and load-shunting
  in rpc_clnt.

- AUTH_SYS support in rpc_clnt.

- Include complete RPC server and RPC client example code in examples/test.

Pre-1.0

Tony Rogvall's original "xdr" package.
