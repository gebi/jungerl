MODULE
       xmlrpc - XML-RPC library

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  an HTTP 1.1 compliant XML-RPC Erlang library. It
       is designed to  make  it  easy  to  write  XML-RPC  Erlang
       clients  and/or servers. The library is compliant with the
       XML-RPC specification published by http://www.xmlrpc.org/.

                     ResponsePayload  =  {response,  [Value]}   |
                     {response, Fault}
                     Fault = {fault, FaultCode, FaultString}
                     FaultCode = integer()
                     FaultString = string()
                     Result  =  {ok,  ResponsePayload}  | {error,
                     Reason} | {ok,  Socket,  ResponsePayload}  |
                     {error, Socket, Reason}
                     Reason = term()

              Calls an XML-RPC server listening on Host:Port. The
              URI and Payload is used in the  HTTP  POST  request
              sent  to  the server. The Value is converted to XML
              (see DATA TYPES below) and is used as request body.

              If  KeepAlive  is  true  a  Socket is returned. The
              socket can be used to send  several  calls  on  the
              same  connection in accordance with HTTP 1.1. If no
              server response is received within  Timeout  milli-
              seconds  {error,  timeout} or {error, Socket, time-
              out} is returned.

              KeepAlive and Timeout default to  false  and  60000
              milli-seconds.

              See EXAMPLES section below.

       start_link(Handler)
       start_link(Port, MaxSessions, Timeout, Handler, State)
       start_link(IP, Port, MaxSessions, Timeout, Handler, State)
       -> Result

              Types  Handler = {Module, Function}
                     Module = Function = atom()
                     Port = MaxSessions = integer()
                     Timeout = integer()
                     State = term()
                     IP = ip()
                     Result = {ok, Pid} | {error, Reason}
                     Pid = pid()
                     Reason = term()

              Starts an XML-RPC server listening on  IP:Port.  If
              no  IP  address is given the server listens on Port
              for all available IP addresses. MaxSessions is used
              to  restrict  the number of concurrent connections.
              If MaxSessions is reached the server accepts no new
              connections  for  5 seconds, i.e. blocking new con-
              nect attempts.

              Handler is a callback, implemented by  Module:Func-
              tion/2,  which  is  used  to  instantiate  your own
              XML-RPC server. The Timeout value is  used  if  the
              handler is keepalive oriented. State is the initial
              state given to Module:Function/2. The resulting Pid
              can be used as input to xmlrpc:stop/1.

              See Module:Function/2 and EXAMPLES below.

       stop(Pid) -> Result

              Types  Pid = pid()
                     Result = void()

              Stops a running XML-RPC server.

       Module:Function(State, Payload) -> Result

              Types  State = term()
                     Payload = <See above>
                     Result   =  {KeepAlive,  ResponsePayload}  |
                     {KeepAlive, State, Timeout, ResponsePayload}
                     KeepAlive = true | false
                     ResponsePayload = <See above>
                     Timeout = integer()

              It  is  up  to you to implement Function clauses in
              Module to  instantiate  your  own  XML-RPC  server.
              Every time an XML-RPC call arrives the Value in the
              Payload it is converted to  Erlang  format  and  is
              passed on to Module:Function/2.

              A  Function  clause  is supposed to return either a
              2-tuple or a 4-tuple. KeepAlive must be false in  a
              2-tuple and true in a 4-tuple. KeepAlive decides if
              the connection to the client should be kept open or
              not,  i.e.  compare  with the KeepAlive argument to
              call/{3,4,5,6} above.

              State can be used as a state variable by the  call-
              back  function and changes made to it is propagated
              to the next call to  Module:Function/2.  The  state
              variable  is only meaningful if both the client and
              the  server  is  keepalive  oriented.  The  Timeout
              specified  in  start_link/{1,5,6} can be updated in
              the returning 4-tuple.

              If KeepAlive is true and  no  call  arrives  within
              Timeout  milli-seconds  the  socket  is closed. The
              socket may be closed by the client before the spec-
              ified timeout.

              See EXAMPLES below.

DATA TYPES
       The  conversion  of  Value  in Payload and ResponsePayload
       (see above) is done as follows:

       XML-RPC data type       Erlang data type
       -----------------       ----------------
       <int>                   integer()
       <boolean>               true or false
       <string>                string()
       <double>                float()
       <dateTime.iso8601>      {date, string()}
       <struct>                {struct, [{Key, Value}]}
       <array>                 {array, [Value]}
       <base64>                {base64, string()}

       Read more about the XML-RPC  data  types  in  the  XML-RPC
       specification published by http://www.xmlrpc.org/.

       Here  are  some examples on how Erlang format is converted
       to XML:

       42     <int>42</int>

       true   <boolean>true</boolean>

       "Kilroy was here"
              <string>Kilroy was here</string>

       42.5   <double>42.5</double>

       {date, "19980717T14:08:55"}
              <dateTime.iso8601>19980717T14:08:55</date-
              Time.iso8601>

       {struct, [{foo, 42}, {bar, 4711}]}
              <struct>
                  <member>
                      <name>foo</name><value><int>42</int></value>
                  </member>
                  <member>
                      <name>bar</name><value><int>4711</int></value>
                  </member>
              </struct>

       {array, [42, 42.5}
              <array>
                  <data>
                      <value><int>42</i4></value>
                      <value><double>42.5</double></value>
                  </data>
              </array>

       {date, "19980717T14:08:55"}
              <dateTime.iso8601>19980717T14:08:55</date-
              Time.iso8601>


EXAMPLES
       You are strongly advised to inspect the  example  code  in
       the examples/ directory.

       The  first  example  (fib_server.erl) calculates Fibonacci
       values and is a non-keepalive server. The  second  example
       (echo_server.erl)  echoes back any incoming parameters and
       is   a   non-keepalive   server.   The    third    example
       (date_server.erl)  calculates  calendar  values  for given
       dates and is a keepalive server which uses the state vari-
       able  to  provide  login  state and different timeout set-
       tings. The fourth example (validator.erl) is a  validation
       server which can be used to validate the library using the
       http://validator.xmlrpc.org/ service.

       Some extract from the examples/ directory.  The  Fibonacci
       callback module:

       handler(_State, {call, fib, [N]}) when integer(N) ->
           {false, {response, [fib(N)]}};
       handler(_State, Payload) ->
           FaultString = lists:flatten(io_lib:format("Unknown call: ~p", [Payload])),
           {false, {response, {fault, -1, FaultString}}}.

       fib(0) -> 1;
       fib(1) -> 1;
       fib(N) -> fib(N-1)+fib(N-2).

       and how it can be called:

       1> xmlrpc:call({127, 0, 0, 1}, 4567, "/", {call, fib, [0]}).
       {ok,{response,[1]}}
       2> xmlrpc:call({127, 0, 0, 1}, 4567, "/", {call, fib, [4]}).
       {ok,{response,[5]}}

       Again:  You  are  strongly  advised to inspect the example
       code in the examples/ directory.
