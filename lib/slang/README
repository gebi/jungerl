This is slang, an erlang interface to the amazing highly portable tty 
interface that gave us such nice tty applications as mutt and slrn

It's distributed as an erlang application (without a start mod) which makes
it possible to integrate into a larger buld environment.
We use this at bluetail to have a terminal application onto our
actual target machine. It can be used to to anything that's possible
to di with the slang lib itself.

It's know to compile and run with slang version 1.4.2

The API is one-to-one withe the normal C-api to slanglib.


demo: contains some various demos
doc:  well .. yes guess what
config: contains configure scripts and stuff

To compile: 

$ (cd config; ./configure)
$ make
